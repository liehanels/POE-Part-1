# My Notebook Project

## Overview
This project is focused on implementing a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model. The RNN will be used for various tasks, including sequence prediction and time series analysis. The project includes a Jupyter notebook for code implementation and documentation.

## Project Structure
- **notebooks/RNN.ipynb**: Contains the code, visualizations, and markdown documentation for the RNN model.
- **data/**: Directory for storing datasets used in the project.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the required Python packages for the project.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd my-notebook-project
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Guidelines
- Open the Jupyter notebook `RNN.ipynb` to view and run the code.
- Ensure that the datasets are placed in the `data/` directory before running the notebook.
- Follow the markdown sections in the notebook for guidance on how to use the implemented RNN model.
